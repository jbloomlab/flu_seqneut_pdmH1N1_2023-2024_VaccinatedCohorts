This directory contains non-pipeline analysis for processing titer data and plotting titers by metadata parameters. This includes the code for generating all plots seen in the paper and all tests for significance.

Note, a single serum sample (PENN23_y1964_s006) was excluded from cohort level analysis as it appeared that the timepoints for this sample had been mixed up (i.e. titers decreased for several recent strains post-vaccination). This samples titers are still available in titer files. All analysis plots were run with and without this individuals sample to confirm that inclusion or exclusion did not impact the overall results or significance of any comparisons that are described.
